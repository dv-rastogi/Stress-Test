# STRESS TEST
#### A stress testing script made by me (finally! :confounded:), in order to test your solutions against brute solutions.

## What is stress testing?
*I shall speak here in reference with Competitve Programming :bow:.*

For optimization problems sometimes your optimized code tends to fail on corner cases which are rather hard to figure out leading to a series of WA/TLE verdicts.

To overcome such annoying issues of brainstorming the aforementioned corner cases yourself, the naive idea of stress testing comes into play.

For the very same problem, you quickly code out a brute solution and hopefully with the help of my script :ok_man: and a random case generator (User parameter), you compare your output against the brute output (User parameter) and hope for a **fail verdict** and *voil√†*, you get the test case your code was failing on!


#### Please refer *stressCheck.py* for modelling required user parameters!

Currently configured for [Combination lock - Google kickstart round G](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/round/00000000001a0069/0000000000414a24)

## How to use
* Code an optimized solution for the problem. *In my repo, it's "T.cpp"*
* Code a brute solution for the problem. *In my repo, it's "brute.cpp"*
* Ensure both your brute & optimized programs recieve input from a file. *In my repo, it's "inputf.in"*
* Update *gen* function in *stressCheck.py* in order to randomly generate your test cases.
* Update *checker* function in *stressCheck.py* in order to form basis of comparison for your response and brute response. *In my repo, it's string comparison*
* Run `make stress` & wait to hopefully retrieve a corner case, lol.
